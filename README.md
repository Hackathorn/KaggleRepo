<h1>Kaggle Repo</h1>

<i>Team Rand</i>

This repository is an organization tool for Team Rand on Kaggle. Most of the codebase can be viewed as Jupyter Notebooks.
These files end in *.ipynb. Contact me for actual submission scripts.

Many of the <b>competition datasets</b> are <b>not included</b> because they are too large. They can be found at the 
from the main page of the competition at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">kaggle.com</a>. If you are 
using the scripts, you should put the competition data in the 'input' folder inside the competition directory, in order 
for the code to run out of the box.

<b>Datasets</b> -> various datasets used by the modules, as well as several canonical, and random datasets.

<b>Explore</b> -> Non-competition exploratory analysis/modeling.

<b>Learn</b> -> Tutorials for some of the popular libraries and concepts used in competition-winning submissions.
